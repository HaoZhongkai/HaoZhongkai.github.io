I’m Chengyang Ying, a first-year PhD student of [TSAIL Group](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.html) in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) and Prof. [Hang Su](https://www.suhangss.me/). My research interest includes machine learning, reinforcement learning and neural network for physics. I also obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/) of Tsinghua University, majored in mathematics and minored in computer application.
