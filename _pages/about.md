I’m Chengyang Ying, a first-year PhD student of TSAIL Group in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) and Prof. [Hang Su](https://www.suhangss.me/). My research interest includes machine learning, reinforcement learning and neural network for physics. I also obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Tsinghua University, majored in mathematics.
